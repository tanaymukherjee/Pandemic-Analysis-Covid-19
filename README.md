# Pandemic-Analysis-Covid-19
I imagine, we all are in a state of shock where we don't really know what's happening with the Corono Virus outbreak, now officially called covid-19. I am creating this repository to keep a track of all the analysis work and and reading around this pandemic.

First and foremost, I pray for everyone's good health and hope this crisis that has fallen upon us will disappear as sudden as it has appeared. I pray for your loved ones, your friends, and colleagues and wish a speedy recovery and strength to the family who have had positive cases. My sincere condolences to people who have had seen tough days and expereienced unbearable loss. We all are together in this. Amen to the good days ahead and strong human resolution to survive tough times.

Maintain social distancing, co-operate to your local authority body and keep everyone in your prayers and be kind and generous. Cheers!
